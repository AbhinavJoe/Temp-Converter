# Temperature Converter

- Run the web app - 

- A program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.
